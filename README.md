**# Node.js REST API with Authentication**

This project implements a RESTful API with user authentication using Node.js and Express. It provides functionalities for managing posts (CRUD operations) and user status retrieval.

## Features

* Secure access to feed and user routes using JWT authentication
* CRUD operations for posts (create, read, update, delete)
* User status retrieval

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-github-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will typically start the server on port `3000` (you can customize this in the code).

2. Use a client-side application (e.g., Postman) or code to interact with the API endpoints:

   * **Authentication:**
     - `POST /auth/login`: Login a user with email and password (body: `{"email": "...", "password": "..."}`)
     - `POST /auth/signup`: Create a new user (body: `{"email": "...", "password": "..."}`)
   * **Feed (requires JWT authorization):**
     - `GET /feed`: Get all posts
     - `GET /feed/:postId`: Get a specific post
     - `POST /feed`: Create a new post (body: `{"title": "...", "content": "..."}`)
     - `PUT /feed/:postId`: Update a post (body: `{"title": "...", "content": "..."}`)
     - `DELETE /feed/:postId`: Delete a post
   * **User:**
     - `GET /user`: Get user status (requires JWT authorization)

## Configuration

* Environment variables can be used to store sensitive information like database connection details and secret keys. Create a `.env` file (not included in version control) and define variables.
  
## Dependencies

This project utilizes the following Node.js packages:

* **bcryptjs:** Secure password hashing
* **body-parser:** Parses incoming request bodies
* **express:** Web framework for building APIs
* **express-validator:** Input validation
* **jsonwebtoken:** JWT token generation and verification
* **mongoose:** ODM (Object Data Modeling) for interacting with MongoDB
* **multer:** File upload handling (if needed for post images)
* **uuid:** Unique identifier generation

## Development Server

This project uses `nodemon` for automatic server restarts during development. Changes in the code will trigger a server restart, allowing you to see the effects immediately.

## Testing

Unit and integration tests are highly recommended for ensuring code quality and robustness. You can use frameworks like Jest or Mocha for writing tests.

## Deployment

For deployment to production, consider options like Heroku, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda), or containerization with Docker and Kubernetes. Refer to their documentation for specific deployment instructions.

## Contribution

Feel free to create pull requests for bug fixes, improvements, or new features. Make sure to follow any coding style guidelines and include unit tests for your changes.
